# caesar_cipher_python

Introduction
      Welcome to my Caesar Cipher project! This project demonstrates a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a specified 
      number of places. The code is written in Python and provides both encoding and decoding functionalities.


Features


      Encode Messages: Shift letters in the plaintext forward by a specified number.
      Decode Messages: Shift letters in the ciphertext backward by a specified number.
      Interactive User Interface: Users can choose to encode or decode messages, input their own text, and specify the shift amount.
      Non-alphabet Characters: These characters remain unchanged during the encoding/decoding process.
      Shift Wrapping: The shift wraps correctly using the modulo operator.



Example


      Here's an example of how to use the Caesar Cipher program:
            Run the script.
            Choose to encode or decode a message.
            Enter your message.
            Enter the shift number.
            See the encoded or decoded result.
